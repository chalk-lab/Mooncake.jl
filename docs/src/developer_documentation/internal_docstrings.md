# Internal Docstrings

Docstrings listed here are _not_ part of the public Mooncake.jl interface.
Consequently, they can change between non-breaking changes to Mooncake.jl without warning.

The purpose of this is to make it easy for developers to find docstrings straightforwardly via the docs, as opposed to having to ctrl+f through Mooncake.jl's source code, or looking at the docstrings via the Julia REPL.
