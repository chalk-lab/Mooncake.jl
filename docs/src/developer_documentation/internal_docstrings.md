# Internal Docstrings

Docstrings listed here are _not_ part of the public Mooncake.jl interface.
Consequently, they can change between non-breaking changes to Mooncake.jl without warning.
Its purpose is to make it easy for developers to find docstrings straightforward via the docs, as opposed to having to ctrl+f through Mooncake.jl's source, or having a Julia session active.

```@autodocs; canonical=false
Modules = [Mooncake]
Public = false
```
