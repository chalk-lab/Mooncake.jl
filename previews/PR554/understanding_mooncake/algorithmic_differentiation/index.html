Even if you have worked with AD before, we recommend reading in order to acclimatise yourself to the perspective that Mooncake.jl takes on the subject.</p><h1 id="Derivatives"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Derivatives">Derivatives</a><a id="Derivatives-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Derivatives" title="Permalink"></a></h1><p>The foundation of automatic differentiation is the directional derivative. Here we build up to a general definition.</p><p><em><strong>Scalar-to-Scalar Functions</strong></em></p><p>Consider first <span>$f : \RR \to \RR$</span>, which we require to be differentiable at <span>$x \in \RR$</span>. Its derivative at <span>$x$</span> is usually thought of as the scalar <span>$\alpha \in \RR$</span> such that</p><p class="math-container">\[\text{d}f = \alpha \, \text{d}x .\]</p><p>Loosely speaking, by this notation we mean <span>$f(x + \text{d} x) \approx f(x) + \text{d} f$</span>, or in other words, that an arbitrarily small change <span>$\text{d} x$</span> to the input <span>$x$</span> results in a change <span>$\text{d} f = \alpha \, \text{d}x$</span> in the output. We refer readers to the first few minutes of the <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-s096-matrix-calculus-for-machine-learning-and-beyond-january-iap-2023/resources/ocw_18s096_lecture01-part2_2023jan18_mp4/">first lecture mentioned before</a> for a more careful explanation.</p><p><em><strong>Vector-to-Vector Functions</strong></em></p><p>The generalisation of this to Euclidean space should be familiar: if <span>$f : \RR^P \to \RR^Q$</span> is differentiable at a point <span>$x \in \RR^P$</span>, then the derivative of <span>$f$</span> at <span>$x$</span> is given by the Jacobian matrix at <span>$x$</span>, denoted <span>$J[x] \in \RR^{Q \times P}$</span>, such that</p><p class="math-container">\[\text{d}f = J[x] \, \text{d}x .\]</p><p>It is possible to stop here, as all the functions we shall need to consider can in principle be written as functions on some subset <span>$\RR^P$</span>.</p><p>However, to differentiate computer programmes, we must deal with complicated nested data structures, e.g. <code>struct</code>s inside <code>Tuple</code>s inside <code>Vector</code>s etc. While all of these data structures <em>can</em> be mapped onto a flat vector in order to make sense of the Jacobian, this quickly becomes very inconvenient. To see the problem, consider the Julia function whose input is of type <code>Tuple{Tuple{Float64, Vector{Float64}}, Vector{Float64}, Float64}</code> and whose output is of type <code>Tuple{Vector{Float64}, Float64}</code>. What kind of object might be use to represent the derivative of a function mapping between these two spaces? We certainly <em>can</em> treat these as structured &quot;view&quot; into a &quot;flat&quot; <code>Vector{Float64}</code>s, and then define a Jacobian, but actually <em>finding</em> this mapping is a tedious exercise, even if it quite obviously exists.</p><p>In fact, a more general formulation of the derivative is used all the time in the context of AD – the matrix calculus discussed by [<a href="#giles2008extended">1</a>] and [<a href="#minka2000old">2</a>] (to name a couple) make use of a generalised form of the derivative in order to work with functions which map to and from matrices (albeit there are slight differences in naming conventions from text to text), without needing to &quot;flatten&quot; them into vectors in order to make sense of them.</p><p>In general, it will be much easier to avoid &quot;flattening&quot; operations wherever possible. In order to do so, we now introduce a generalised notion of the derivative.</p><p><em><strong>Functions Between More General Spaces</strong></em></p><p>In order to avoid the difficulties described above, we consider functions <span>$f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$</span>, where <span>$\mathcal{X}$</span> and <span>$\mathcal{Y}$</span> are <em>finite</em> dimensional real Hilbert spaces (read: finite-dimensional vector space with an inner product, and real-valued scalars). This definition includes functions to and from <span>$\RR$</span>, <span>$\RR^D$</span>, real-valued matrices, and any other &quot;container&quot; for collections of real numbers. Furthermore, we shall see later how we can model all sorts of structured representations of data directly as such spaces.</p><p>For such spaces, the derivative of <span>$f$</span> at <span>$x \in \mathcal{X}$</span> is the linear operator (read: linear function) <span>$D f [x] : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$</span> satisfying</p><p class="math-container">\[\text{d}f = D f [x] \, (\text{d} x)\]</p><p>The purpose of this linear operator is to provide a linear approximation to <span>$f$</span> which is accurate for arguments which are very close to <span>$x$</span>.</p><p>Please note that <span>$D f [x]$</span> is a single mathematical object, despite being three separate symbols: <span>$D f [x] (\dot{x})$</span> denotes the application of the function <span>$D f [x]$</span> to argument <span>$\dot{x}$</span>. Furthermore, the dot-notation (<span>$\dot{x}$</span>) does not have anything to do with time-derivatives, it is simply common notation used in the AD literature to denote the arguments of derivatives.</p><p>So, instead of thinking of the derivative as a number or a matrix, we think about it as a <em>function</em>. We can express the previous notions of the derivative in this language.</p><p>In the scalar case, rather than thinking of the derivative as <em>being</em> <span>$\alpha$</span>, we think of it is a the linear operator <span>$D f [x] (\dot{x}) := \alpha \dot{x}$</span>. Put differently, rather than thinking of the derivative as the slope of the tangent to <span>$f$</span> at <span>$x$</span>, think of it as the function decribing the tangent itself. Observe that up until now we had only considered inputs to <span>$D f [x]$</span> which were small (<span>$\text{d} x$</span>) – here we extend it to the entire space <span>$\mathcal{X}$</span> and denote inputs in this space <span>$\dot{x}$</span>. Inputs <span>$\dot{x}$</span> should be thoughts of as &quot;directions&quot;, in the directional derivative sense (why this is true will be discussed later).</p><p>Similarly, if <span>$\mathcal{X} = \RR^P$</span> and <span>$\mathcal{Y} = \RR^Q$</span> then this operator can be specified in terms of the Jacobian matrix: <span>$D f [x] (\dot{x}) := J[x] \dot{x}$</span> – brackets are used to emphasise that <span>$D f [x]$</span> is a function, and is being applied to <span>$\dot{x}$</span>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="citeref-note_for_geometers" href="#footnote-note_for_geometers">[note_for_geometers]</a></sup></p><p>To reiterate, for the rest of this document, we define the derivative to be &quot;multiply by <span>$\alpha$</span>&quot; or &quot;multiply by <span>$J[x]$</span>&quot;, rather than to <em>be</em> <span>$\alpha$</span> or <span>$J[x]$</span>. So whenever you see the word &quot;derivative&quot;, you should think &quot;linear function&quot;.</p><p><em><strong>The Chain Rule</strong></em></p><p>The chain rule is <em>the</em> result which makes AD work. Fortunately, it applies to this version of the derivative:</p><p class="math-container">\[f = g \circ h \implies D f [x] = (D g [h(x)]) \circ (D h [x])\]</p><p>By induction, this extends to a collection of <span>$N$</span> functions <span>$f_1, \dots, f_N$</span>:</p><p class="math-container">\[f := f_N \circ \dots \circ f_1 \implies D f [x] = (D f_N [x_N]) \circ \dots \circ (D f_1 [x_1]),\]</p><p>where <span>$x_{n+1} := f(x_n)$</span>, and <span>$x_1 := x$</span>.</p><p><em><strong>An aside: the definition of the Frechet Derivative</strong></em></p><p>This definition of the derivative has a name: the Frechet derivative. It is a generalisation of the Total Derivative. Formally, we say that a function <span>$f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$</span> is differentiable at a point <span>$x \in \mathcal{X}$</span> if there exists a linear operator <span>$D f [x] : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$</span> (the derivative) satisfying</p><p class="math-container">\[\lim_{\text{d} h \to 0} \frac{\| f(x + \text{d} h) - f(x) + D f [x] (\text{d} h)  \|_\mathcal{Y}}{\| \text{d}h \|_\mathcal{X}} = 0,\]</p><p>where <span>$\| \cdot \|_\mathcal{X}$</span> and <span>$\| \cdot \|_\mathcal{Y}$</span> are the norms associated to Hilbert spaces <span>$\mathcal{X}$</span> and <span>$\mathcal{Y}$</span> respectively. (The Frechet derivative does not depend on the choice of norms. All norms are <em>equivalent</em> in finite dimensions, meaning they define the same topology and notion of convergence: if this equation is satisfied for one norm, it holds for all.)</p><p>It is a good idea to consider what this looks like when <span>$\mathcal{X} = \mathcal{Y} = \RR$</span> and when <span>$\mathcal{X} = \mathcal{Y} = \RR^D$</span>. It is sometimes helpful to refer to this definition to e.g. verify the correctness of the derivative of a function – as with single-variable calculus, however, this is rare.</p><p><em><strong>Another aside: what does Forwards-Mode AD compute?</strong></em></p><p>At this point we have enough machinery to discuss forwards-mode AD. Expressed in the language of linear operators and Hilbert spaces, the goal of forwards-mode AD is the following: given a function <span>$f$</span> which is differentiable at a point <span>$x$</span>, compute <span>$D f [x] (\dot{x})$</span> for a given vector <span>$\dot{x}$</span>. If <span>$f : \RR^P \to \RR^Q$</span>, this is equivalent to computing <span>$J[x] \dot{x}$</span>, where <span>$J[x]$</span> is the Jacobian of <span>$f$</span> at <span>$x$</span>. For the interested reader we provide a high-level explanation of <em>how</em> forwards-mode AD does this in <a href="#*How*-does-Forwards-Mode-AD-work?"><em>How</em> does Forwards-Mode AD work?</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Another aside: notation</strong></em></p><p>You may have noticed that we typically denote the argument to a derivative with a &quot;dot&quot; over it, e.g. <span>$\dot{x}$</span>. This is something that we will do consistently, and we will use the same notation for the outputs of derivatives. Wherever you see a symbol with a &quot;dot&quot; over it, expect it to be an input or output of a derivative / forwards-mode AD.</p><h1 id="Reverse-Mode-AD:-*what*-does-it-do?"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Reverse-Mode-AD:-*what*-does-it-do?">Reverse-Mode AD: <em>what</em> does it do?</a><a id="Reverse-Mode-AD:-*what*-does-it-do?-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Reverse-Mode-AD:-*what*-does-it-do?" title="Permalink"></a></h1><p>In order to explain what reverse-mode AD does, we first consider the &quot;vector-Jacobian product&quot; definition in Euclidean space which will be familiar to many readers. We then generalise.</p><p><em><strong>Reverse-Mode AD: what does it do in Euclidean space?</strong></em></p><p>In this setting, the goal of reverse-mode AD is the following: given a function <span>$f : \RR^P \to \RR^Q$</span> which is differentiable at <span>$x \in \RR^P$</span> with Jacobian <span>$J[x]$</span> at <span>$x$</span>, compute <span>$J[x]^\top \bar{y}$</span> for any <span>$\bar{y} \in \RR^Q$</span>. This is useful because we can obtain the gradient from this when <span>$Q = 1$</span> by letting <span>$\bar{y} = 1$</span>.</p><p><em><strong>Adjoint Operators</strong></em></p><p>In order to generalise this algorithm to work with linear operators, we must first generalise the idea of multiplying a vector by the transpose of the Jacobian. The relevant concept here is the <em>adjoint</em> of a linear operator. Specifically, the adjoint <span>$A^\ast$</span> of linear operator <span>$A$</span> is the linear operator satisfying</p><p class="math-container">\[\langle A^\ast \bar{y}, \dot{x} \rangle = \langle \bar{y}, A \dot{x} \rangle.\]</p><p>for any <span>$\dot{x}, \bar{y}$</span>, where <span>$\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$</span> denotes the inner-product. The relationship between the adjoint and matrix transpose is: if <span>$A (x) := J x$</span> for some matrix <span>$J$</span>, then <span>$A^\ast (y) := J^\top y$</span>.</p><p>Moreover, just as <span>$(A B)^\top = B^\top A^\top$</span> when <span>$A$</span> and <span>$B$</span> are matrices, <span>$(A B)^\ast = B^\ast A^\ast$</span> when <span>$A$</span> and <span>$B$</span> are linear operators. This result follows in short order from the definition of the adjoint operator – (and is a good exercise!)</p><p><em><strong>Reverse-Mode AD: what does it do in general?</strong></em></p><p>Equipped with adjoints, we can express reverse-mode AD only in terms of linear operators, dispensing with the need to express everything in terms of Jacobians. The goal of reverse-mode AD is as follows: given a differentiable function <span>$f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$</span>, compute <span>$D f [x]^\ast (\bar{y})$</span> for some <span>$\bar{y}$</span>.</p><p>Notation: <span>$D f [x]^\ast$</span> denotes the single mathematical object which is the adjoint of <span>$D f [x]$</span>. It is a linear function from <span>$\mathcal{Y}$</span> to <span>$\mathcal{X}$</span>. We may occassionally write it as <span>$(D f [x])^\ast$</span> if there is some risk of confusion.</p><p>We will explain <em>how</em> reverse-mode AD goes about computing this after some worked examples.</p><p><em><strong>Aside: Notation</strong></em></p><p>You will have noticed that arguments to adjoints have thus far always had a &quot;bar&quot; over them, e.g. <span>$\bar{y}$</span>. This notation is common in the AD literature and will be used throughout. Additionally, this &quot;bar&quot; notation will be used for the outputs of adjoints of derivatives. So wherever you see a symbol with a &quot;bar&quot; over it, think &quot;input or output of adjoint of derivative&quot;.</p><h3 id="Some-Worked-Examples"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Some-Worked-Examples">Some Worked Examples</a><a id="Some-Worked-Examples-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Some-Worked-Examples" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>We now present some worked examples in order to prime intuition, and to introduce the important classes of problems that will be encountered when doing AD in the Julia language. We will put all of these problems in a single general framework later on.</p><h4 id="An-Example-with-Matrix-Calculus"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#An-Example-with-Matrix-Calculus">An Example with Matrix Calculus</a><a id="An-Example-with-Matrix-Calculus-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#An-Example-with-Matrix-Calculus" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>We have introduced some mathematical abstraction in order to simplify the calculations involved in AD. To this end, we consider differentiating <span>$f(X) := X^\top X$</span>. Results for this and similar operations are given by [<a href="#giles2008extended">1</a>]. A similar operation, but which maps from matrices to <span>$\RR$</span> is discussed in Lecture 4 part 2 of the MIT course mentioned previouly. Both [<a href="#giles2008extended">1</a>] and <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-s096-matrix-calculus-for-machine-learning-and-beyond-january-iap-2023/resources/ocw_18s096_lecture04-part2_2023jan26_mp4/">Lecture 4 part 2</a> provide approaches to obtaining the derivative of this function.</p><p>Following either resource will yield the derivative:</p><p class="math-container">\[D f [X] (\dot{X}) = \dot{X}^\top X + X^\top \dot{X}\]</p><p>Observe that this is indeed a linear operator (i.e. it is linear in its argument, <span>$\dot{X}$</span>). (You can always plug it in to the definition of the Frechet derivative to confirm that it is indeed the derivative.)</p><p>In order to perform reverse-mode AD, we need to find the adjoint operator. Using the usual definition of the inner product between matrices,</p><p class="math-container">\[\langle X, Y \rangle := \textrm{tr} (X^\top Y)\]</p><p>we can rearrange the inner product as follows:</p><p class="math-container">\[\begin{align*}
\langle\bar{Y},Df[X](\dot{X})\rangle &amp; =\langle\bar{Y},\dot{X}^{\top}X+X^{\top}\dot{X}\rangle\\
 &amp; =\textrm{tr}(\bar{Y}^{\top}\left(\dot{X}^{\top}X+X^{\top}\dot{X}\right))\\
 &amp; =\textrm{tr}(\dot{X}^{\top}X\bar{Y}^{\top})+\textrm{tr}(\bar{Y}^{\top}X^{\top}\dot{X})\\
 &amp; =\langle\dot{X},X\bar{Y}^{\top}\rangle+\langle X\bar{Y},\dot{X}\rangle\\
 &amp; =\langle X\bar{Y}^{\top}+X\bar{Y},\dot{X}\rangle.
\end{align*}\]</p><p>The linearity of inner products and trace, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_(linear_algebra)#Cyclic_property">cyclic property of trace</a> was used in the above. We can read off the adjoint operator from the first argument to the inner product:</p><p class="math-container">\[\begin{align*}
Df\left[X\right]^{*}\left(\bar{Y}\right) &amp; =X\bar{Y}^{\top}+X\bar{Y}\\
 &amp; =X\left(\bar{Y}^{\top}+\bar{Y}\right).
\end{align*}\]</p><h4 id="AD-of-a-Julia-function:-a-trivial-example"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#AD-of-a-Julia-function:-a-trivial-example">AD of a Julia function: a trivial example</a><a id="AD-of-a-Julia-function:-a-trivial-example-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#AD-of-a-Julia-function:-a-trivial-example" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>We now turn to differentiating Julia <code>function</code>s (we use <code>function</code> to refer to the programming language construct, and function to refer to a more general mathematical concept). The way that Mooncake.jl handles immutable data is very similar to how Zygote / ChainRules do. For example, consider the Julia function</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">f(x::Float64) = sin(x)</code></pre><p>If you&#39;ve previously worked with ChainRules / Zygote, without thinking too hard about the formalisms we introduced previously (perhaps by considering a variety of partial derivatives) you can probably arrive at the following adjoint for the derivative of <code>f</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">g -&gt; g * cos(x)</code></pre><p>Implicitly, you have performed three steps:</p><ol><li>model <code>f</code> as a differentiable function,</li><li>compute its derivative, and</li><li>compute the adjoint of the derivative.</li></ol><p>It is helpful to work through this simple example in detail, as the steps involved apply more generally.

From this, we can obtain the adjoint of <span>$f$</span> by applying the chain rule to the derivatives and taking the adjoint:</p><p class="math-container">\[\begin{align}

One option to compute its adjoint is to figure it out by hand directly (probably using the chain rule somewhere). Instead, we could notice that <span>$f = f_4 \circ f_3 \circ f_2 \circ f_1$</span> where <span>$f_4 := \sin$</span>, <span>$f_3 := \cos$</span>, <span>$f_2 := \text{tr}$</span> and <span>$f_1(X) = X^\top X$</span>.

Reverse-mode AD essentially just does this. Modern systems have hand-written adjoints for (hopefully!) all of the &quot;simple&quot; functions you may wish to build a function such as <span>$f$</span> from (often there are hundreds of these), and composes them to compute the adjoint of <span>$f$</span>.
