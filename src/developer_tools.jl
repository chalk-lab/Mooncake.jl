    This is not part of the public interface of Mooncake. As such, it may change as 
    part of a non-breaking release of the package.

Get the `Core.Compiler.IRCode` associated to `sig` from which the a rule can be derived.
Roughly equivalent to `Base.code_ircode_by_type(sig; interp)`.

For example, if you wanted to get the IR associated to the call `map(sin, randn(10))`, you
could do one of the following calls:
```jldoctest
julia> Mooncake.primal_ir(Tuple{typeof(map), typeof(sin), Vector{Float64}}) isa Core.Compiler.IRCode
true
julia> Mooncake.primal_ir(typeof((map, sin, randn(10)))) isa Core.Compiler.IRCode
true
```

    return generate_ir(interp, sig).primal_ir
end

    This is not part of the public interface of Mooncake. As such, it may change as
    part of a non-breaking release of the package.

Generate the `Core.Compiler.IRCode` used to construct the forwards-pass of AD. Take a look
at how `build_rrule` makes use of `generate_ir` to see exactly how this is used in practice.

For example, if you wanted to get the IR associated to the forwards pass for the call
`map(sin, randn(10))`, you could do either of the following:
```jldoctest
julia> Mooncake.fwd_ir(Tuple{typeof(map), typeof(sin), Vector{Float64}}) isa Core.Compiler.IRCode
true
julia> Mooncake.fwd_ir(typeof((map, sin, randn(10)))) isa Core.Compiler.IRCode
true
```

# Arguments
- `sig::Type{<:Tuple}`: the signature of the call to be differentiated.

# Keyword Arguments
- `interp`: the interpreter to use to obtain the primal IR.
- `debug_mode::Bool`: whether the generated IR should make use of Mooncake's debug mode.
- `do_inline::Bool`: whether to apply an inlining pass prior to returning the ir generated
    by this function. This is `true` by default, but setting it to `false` can sometimes be
    helpful if you need to understand what function calls are generated in order to perform
    AD, before lots of it gets inlined away.
