    LineToADDataMap

The "AD data associated to line id" is all of the data that is shared between the forwards-
and reverse-passes associated to line `id` in an `BBCode`.

An `LineToADDataMap` is characterised by a `Dict{ID, Int}`. Each `key` the `ID` of a line
number in the primal `BBCode`, and each `value` is the unique position associated to it in a
`Tuple` which gets shared between the forwards- and reverse-passes.

This map will generally only have keys for a subset of the `ID`s in the primal `BBCode`
because many of the lines in primal `BBCode` do not need to share between the forwards- and
reverse-passes. This means that we can keep the size of the `Tuple` that must be shared
between the forwards- and reverse-passes as small as possible. For example, `PhiNode`s and
terminators never need to share information, nor do `:invoke` expressions which provably
have the `NoPullback` pullback.
=#
struct LineToADDataMap
    m::Dict{ID, Int}
    LineToADDataMap() = new(Dict{ID, Int}())
end

#=
    get_storage_location!(m::LineToADDataMap, line::ID)

Return the location in the `Tuple` shared between the forwards- and reverse-passes
associated to line `line`. If `m` does not already have an entry for `line`,
create one, insert it into `m`, and return it.
=#
function get_storage_location!(m::LineToADDataMap, line::ID)
    (line in keys(m.m)) || setindex!(m.m, length(m.m) + 1, line)
    return m.m[line]
end

#=
    ADInfo(terminator_block_id::ID, line_map::LineToADDataMap)

This data structure is used to hold global information which gets passed around, in
particular to `make_ad_stmts!`.

- `interp`: a `TapedInterpreter`.
- `terminator_block_id`: the ID of the block inserted to provide a unique exit point on the
    forwards-pass.
- `line_map`: a `LineToADDataMap`.
- `arg_types`: a map from `Argument` to its static type.
- `ssa_types`: a map from `ID` associated to lines to their static type.
=#
struct ADInfo
    interp::TInterp
    terminator_block_id::ID
    line_map::LineToADDataMap
    arg_types::Dict{Argument, Any}
    ssa_types::Dict{ID, Any}
end

# Returns the statically-inferred type associated to `x`.

end

#=
    ADStmtInfo

Data structure which contains the result of `make_ad_stmts!`. Fields are
- `fwds`: the instruction which runs the forwards-pass of AD
- `rvs`: the instruction which runs the reverse-pass of AD / the pullback
- `data`: data which must be made available to the forwards- and reverse-pass of AD

For `rvs`, a value of `nothing` indicates that there should be no instruction associated
to the primal statement in the pullback.

For `data`, a value of `nothing` indicates that there is no data that needs to be shared
between the forwards-pass and pullback, and that there is no need to allocate an element of
the tuple which is shared between the forwards-pass and pullback to this primal line.
=#
struct ADStmtInfo

    data
end

#=
    make_ad_stmts(stmt, id::ID, info::ADInfo)::ADStmtInfo

Every line in the primal code is associated to exactly one line in the forwards-pass of AD,
and either one or zero lines in the pullback (many nodes do not need to appear in the
pullback at all). This function specifies this translation for every type of node.

Translates the statement `stmt`, associated to `id` in the primal, into a specification of
what should happen for this statement in the forwards- and reverse-passes of AD, and what
data should be shared between the forwards- and reverse-passes. Returns this in the form of
an `ADStmtInfo`.

`info` is a data structure containing various bits of global information that certain types
of nodes need access to.
