Functions should only be primitives in this context if not making them so would cause AD to
fail. In particular, do not add primitives to this context if you are writing them for
performance only -- instead, make these primitives in the DefaultCtx.

Context for all usually used AD primitives. Anything which is a primitive in a MinimalCtx is
a primitive in the DefaultCtx automatically. If you are adding a rule for the sake of
performance, it should be a primitive in the DefaultCtx, but not the MinimalCtx.

    @is_primitive context_type signature

Creates a method of `is_primitive` which always returns `true` for the context_type and
`signature` provided. For example
```julia
@is_primitive MinimalCtx Tuple{typeof(foo), Float64}
```
is equivalent to
```julia
is_primitive(::MinimalCtx, ::Type{<:Tuple{typeof(foo), Float64}}) = true
```

You should implemented more complicated method of `is_primitive` in the usual way.
